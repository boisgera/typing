### Typing Module

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>

### Visual Studio Code

**Out of the box.** (with only the [Python extension for VS code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-python.python))
Can understand and propagate (infer) some typing info, so that the type of some
variables in the code is known and visible when we hover some variable.

**Extensions.** [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
